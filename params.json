E.g. for accessing a specific file:\r\n\r\n```fsharp\r\n let url = \"http://101companies.org/resources/contributions/javaStatic/src/test/java/org/softlang/company/tests/CutTest.java\"\r\n    let target = OneOhOne.File(url)\r\n\r\n    printfn \"%s\" target.classifier\r\n    printfn \"%s\" target.language\r\n    target.derived |> Seq.iter( fun derived ->\r\n        printfn \"%s\" derived.name\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n### How does it work\r\nThe types are dynamically generated based on the JSON schemas that can also be found on the [101worker repository](https://github.com/101companies/101worker/tree/master/schemas). The actual data is delivered by 101explorer.\r\n\r\nSo, for example the [file schema](https://github.com/101companies/101worker/blob/master/schemas/101repo_file.json):\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n        \"classifier\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"classifier of this entity\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"geshi\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"string\",\r\n            \"description\": \"geshi code that can be used for highlighting\"\r\n        },\r\n        \"derived\": {\r\n            \"type\": \"array\",\r\n            \"description\": \"array of all derived files\",\r\n            \"items\": {\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill get transformed to a normal F# type with full IDE support:\r\n\r\n![typeproviderscreenshot](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1643263/1016713/7c7a3ce0-0c00-11e3-8467-cea3d02c7652.png)\r\n\r\n### How well does it work\r\nWell, its pretty fresh and I don't think I'll continue it, but it was a decent excercise ;)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSo far, @martinleinberger is the only developer.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nThere is no support :>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
